    specify it, it will be the value the next address (as if you had
    specified n+1 in the last x command).

											8.14.6. Manipulating CPU Registers

  set reg = expr    Change a CPU register to value of expression.
                    Currently only general purpose registers and instruction pointer
                    are supported. You may not change eflags, segment registers,
                    floating point or SIMD registers.

    Examples: set eax = 2+2/2
              set esi = 2*eax+ebx

											8.14.7. Disassembly commands

  disassemble start end       Disassemble instructions in given linear address
                              range, inclusive of start, exclusive of end.
                              Use "set $disassemble_size =" to tell
                              debugger desired segment size.  Use a value for
                              end of less than start (or zero) if you only
                              want the first instruction disassembled.

  disassemble switch-mode     Switch between Intel and AT&T disassebly styles
                              for debugger disassembler.

  disassemble size = n        Tell debugger what segment size to use when
                              the "disassemble" command is used.  Use values
                              of 0, 16 or 32 for n.  Value of 0 means
			      "use segment size specified by current CS
			      segment". Default is 0.

  set $auto_disassemble = n   Cause debugger to disassemble current instruction
                              every time execution stops if n=1.  Default is 0.
                              Segment size of current CPU context is used for
                              disassembly, so the "disassemble size" variable is
                              ignored.

  set disassemble on          The same as 'set $auto_disassemble = 1'
  set disassemble off         The same as 'set $auto_disassemble = 0'
											8.14.8. Instruction tracing

  trace on                    Disassemble every executed instruction. Note
                              that instructions which caused exceptions are
                              not really executed, and therefore not traced.

  trace off                   Disable instruction tracing.
											8.14.9. Instrumentation


To use instrumentation features in bochs, you must compile in support for it. You should build a custom instrumentation library in a separate directory in the "instrument/" directory. To tell configure which instrumentation library you want to use, use the --enable-instrumentation option. The default library consists of a set of stubs, and the following are equivalent:

  ./configure [...] --enable-instrumentation
  ./configure [...] --enable-instrumentation="instrument/stubs"
You could make a separate directory with your custom library, for example "instrument/myinstrument", copy the contents of the "instrument/stubs" directory to it, then customize it. Use:
  ./configure [...] --enable-instrumentation="instrument/myinstrument"
8.14.10. Instrumentation commands

  instrument [command]        calls BX_INSTR_DEBUG_CMD instrumentation callback with [command]
8.14.11. Other Commands

ptime
Print the current time (number of ticks since start of simulation).
sb delta
Insert a time break point "delta" instructions into the future ("delta" is a 64-bit integer followed by "L", for example 1000L).
sba time
Insert a time break point at "time" ("time" is a 64-bit integer followed by "L", for example 1000L).
print-stack [num words]
Print the num words top 16-bit words on the stack. Num words defaults to 16. Only works reliably in protected mode when the base address of the stack segment is zero.
modebp
Toggles CPU mode switch breakpoint.
ldsym [global] filename [offset]
Load symbols from file filename. If the global keyword is added, then the the symbols will be visible in all contexts for which symbols have not been loaded. Offset (default is 0) is added to every symbol entry. The symbols are loaded in the current (executing) context.
The symbol file consists of zero or more lines of the format

"%x %s"
.
show [string]
  Toggles show symbolic info (calls to begin with).
  show - shows current show mode
  show mode     - show, when processor switch mode
  show int      - show, when interrupt is happens
  show call     - show, when call is happens
